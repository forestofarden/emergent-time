- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The block takes two parameters, request and params. The params that are passed into the block are <b>just</b> the placeholder params from the route. If you want the full parsed params, use request.params.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The rationale for this is that request.params is a fairly slow operation, and if the full params parsing is not required, we would rather not do the full parsing.
