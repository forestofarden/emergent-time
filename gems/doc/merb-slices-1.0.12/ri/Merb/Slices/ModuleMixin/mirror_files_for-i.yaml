- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Copy files from specified component path types to their app-level location
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: App-level overrides are preserved by creating duplicates before writing gem-level files. Because of their _override postfix they will load after their original implementation. In the case of views, this won't work, but the user override is preserved nonetheless.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@return &lt;Array[Array]&gt;"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Array of two arrays, one for all copied files, the other for overrides\n  that may have been preserved to resolve collisions.\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@note Only explicitly defined component paths will be taken into account to avoid"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  cluttering the app's Merb.root by mistake - since undefined paths default to that.\n"
