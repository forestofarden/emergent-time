	<h3>Citation ranking</h3>

	<p>Search is useful in itself &#8211; but consider the graph of events for
your keyword query a moment longer. It&#8217;s not a graph of <em>all</em> the events that
match your search, but of the <em>most highly cited</em> ones. In general, these fall
into two categories:</p>

	<p>(1) Accurately reported events that are important enough to play a role in
many different timelines.  For example, the signing of the United States
Declaration of Independence on August 2, 1776.</p>

		<p>(2) Highly controversial misinterpretations of the facts, influential views
that have since been superceded, and common misinformation.  For example, 
that the United States declared independence from Britain on July 4, 1776.[<a href="#fn1">*</a>]
As this example illustrates, in these cases even influential misinformation
is a significant part of the whole story.</p>

	<p>In other words, the graph shows events that would appear in a textbook or
basic introduction on your topic, with some historiographical details as well.</p>

	<p id="fn1">[*] Actually, the documents make clear that Congress voted to declare 
independence on July 2, 1776 and signed the document on August 2, 1776.</p>

	<h3 id="emergent">Emergent properties</h3>

	<p>Certainly, one or two users might have created timelines that include
blatantly wrong information &#8211; say, that the United States declared
independence on July 14, 1789. However, as others construct their timelines,
they&#8217;ll generally choose to use events that reflect their best judgment, so as
not to discredit their own work.</p>

	<p>So Emergent Time aggregates many users&#8217; work on their independent timelines to
form a shared timeline that reflects the community&#8217;s current overall
understanding.</p>

	<p>For most historical topics, this means the collective timeline 
for a given topic will show an accurate overview of major events. The more active
the Emergent Time community is in a particular area, the more focused the overview
timeline.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s an example of what scientists call an &#8220;emergent property.&#8221;  Many
individuals operate in an environment, forming complex and evocative patterns as a
collective.</p>

	<h3>Behind the curtain</h3>

	<p>How does it all work?  Emergent Time incorporates on the same link analysis
algorithm as Google search (called <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf" target="_blank">PageRank</a>).  </p>

	<p>But instead of using it to rank web pages, Emergent Time looks at people&#8217;s
timelines, events, and comments.  Using a highly-ranked event strengthens your
timeline&#8217;s ranking; and conversely, events that play a role in an important
timeline receive a boost too.  This helps Emergent Time locate events that 
are highly important to the community, and foreground them.</p>

  <p>It's a very different approach to digital humanities than past work on
textual criticism or computational linguistics.  Instead it focuses on collaboration
and the practice of research.  It finds value and knowledge embedded in the social relations between scholars,
and works to bring that collective thought process to light.</p>

	<p>N.B. Emergent Time has no affiliation with Google, nor does it use Google&#8217;s index
service.  It merely uses an algorithm similar to PageRank to analyze citations.</p>
